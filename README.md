## Conclusions and recommendations:

- The outlets that will be established should be in tier 3 because the most considerable sales are there.
- They should focus on vegetables, fruit products, snack food, and household products in their new outlet. 
- They should focus on baking goods because their prices are low.
- They should avoid seafood and starchy food in tier 3.
- They should increase the prices to increase their sales.
